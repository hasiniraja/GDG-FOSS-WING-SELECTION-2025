VS Code, Sublime Text
These we use in our daily life, and without VS Code, it's really hard to work on projects.

Explored these while learning machine learning.

Version Control & Collaboration:
Git, GitHub

Browser:
Mozilla Firefox

Web & Backend Development:
Node.js

Other Useful Open-Source Tools:
Postman (free open version), OBS Studio (screen recording and live streaming)

**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: 
During the technical meet of GDG and Axios I was really fascinated by the FOSS Wing and the idea of collaborative development is really nice. During a project development there may be many people in the team but only some of them really contribute, open source clearly will demonstrate this difference. I want to be a part of this wing and connect with like-minded peers and want to learn new things and a deeper version of this field.I want to share the knowledge my seniors have given to me with juniors, give them the same level of motivation that my seniors have given me. 

**Any other wing(s) you have applie to?**:
Yes, I would like to apply to MACHINE LEARNING wing in the technical side and OUTREACH wing on the non-technical side.

**Are you interested in participating in any of the global open-source programs like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, SOB etc? If yes, mention it**:
Yes, I am interested in taking part in GSoC, Outreachy(very useful for women in technical side) and also try SOB once again.

**Anything else you would like to share (Links, projects, PRs or something else) with us?**:
I would like to share my experience in the Summer Of Bitcoin 2025,
I have participated in the bootcamp for SOB 2025 after my initial application got selected and I have successfully submitted the solution for the week1 assignment which involved certain tasks related to interaction with a Bitcoin Node.
And my assignment also got evaluated and accepted and I also successfully submitted my assignment for the Week2 which involved Building a P2SH-P2WSH Multisig Tx. But unfortunately my assignment did not meet the passing criterion.

I have participated in the FOSS Weekend activity and we made our projects academic and personal ones using the git version control system and 
the links to my projects are mentioned -
EchoMix - https://github.com/hasiniraja/Elites
Learnify - https://github.com/hasiniraja/Learnifyy
CookAndChill - https://github.com/hasiniraja/CookAndChill

What I hope to contribute:
Mentor and assist newcomers in their first steps into open source, helping them with Git, PRs, and understanding project workflows.
Promote the wing's activities and help build a vibrant, collaborative community.
